# First

This is my first (or actually second, and third...) commit in my pursuit learning Github and Python

I love python. Having a real-life issue in life helps learn programming.

This small snippet of code is to compare two lists of email-addresses. If the first is not in the second (and reverse) it will drop a line.

Gory stuff, but it makes my life easier...
Also, I committed this file to Github to share information. This, thanks to my collegue Jacques (love!)

Cheers!
Diederik
